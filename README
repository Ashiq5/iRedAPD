About
-----

iRedAPD is a Mailing List Access Policyd Daemon which works as a
Postfix Policy Access Delegation deamon and uses LDAP to store access 
policy.

License
-------

iRedAPD is based on mlapd (http://code.google.com/p/mlapd) which is a
GPLv2 licensed open source software, so iRedAPD is released under
the same license - GPLv2.

Note: file src/daemon.py is released under its own license, shipped
here for easy deploying.

Requirments:
------------

* Python ( >= 2.4 )
* python-ldap ( >= 2.2.0 )

Postfix and LDAP are not needed on the same server machine where you
are going to install iRedAPD, but they have to be reached by iRedAPD to
make it working!
